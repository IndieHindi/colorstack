# ColorStack

ColorStack is an engaging color pattern matching game where players stack colored blocks in tubes to match target patterns.

## Game Overview

In ColorStack, you're presented with a grid of multicolored squares at the bottom of the screen and an empty vertical tube at the top. Your goal is to drag and drop squares into the tube to create specific color patterns shown on the side.

## Key Features

- **Color Stacking**: Colors stack in the tube based on the order you add them
- **Pattern Matching**: When you match the target pattern, the colors burst with a satisfying animation and you earn points
- **Strategic Gameplay**: The tube has limited space, so you must be strategic
- **Mistake Recovery**: If you make a mistake, you can tap to remove the top color (but lose time)
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with simple patterns and advance to more complex challenges
- **Visual Satisfaction**: Beautiful color interactions and animations when you succeed

## Game Progression

- **Early Levels**: Simple 3-4 color patterns
- **Mid Levels**: Patterns with repeated colors and specific sequences
- **Advanced Levels**: Multiple tubes to fill simultaneously, color mixing mechanics

## How to Play

1. Choose a difficulty level to start the game
2. Drag colors from the palette at the bottom to the tube
3. Match the target patterns shown on the left side
4. Click the top block in the tube to remove it if you made a mistake
5. Complete patterns before time runs out to advance to the next level
